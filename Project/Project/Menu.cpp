/*
 The way the menu is set up in the text file is:
 1.)"Title:"
 Sets the name of the menu incase the user wants to rename the name of their menus and categorize the way the wants it.
 2.) "Item:"
 the word after "Item:" will set the name of the item whatever they want to call their item. the code is make so they can add more than one word to an item. example, if they want to add hot dog to their menu the program would recognize that there are more words to follow that particular menu item
 3.) "Price:"
 After "Price:" the user is able to set the price of the item
 4.) "Done"
 once the programs read "done", it means that the current menu is done and is now time to move to the next menu
