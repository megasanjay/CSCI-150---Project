# CSCI-150---Project - Restaurant Order Management System

There are two files. The first folder is for people using Visual Studio and the second one is for Xcode. Choose responsibly.

Might want to change the path to the text filed in the 'Menu', 'Stats' and 'Login' files. 

Login passswords are enctypted. I've used the same name for simplicity. 

Manager login - adam:adam

Waitstaff login - maria:maria

I've forgotten the rest ðŸ˜“. Y'all can add a login if you want. The feature is available if you login as a 'Manager'.

'Chef' functionality is currently only availabe as a 'Manager'. Not adding a new login yet, probably for a future release.


Visual studio project is up. Download 'Visual Studio Community' here : https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
